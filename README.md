# Parametric Design Repository



## Introduction

Welcome to the Parametric Design Repository! This repository contains various parametric designs implemented using Python. 
Parametric design is a creative approach that involves using mathematical equations and parameters to generate visually appealing patterns.

My goal is to master this form of art and update this repository with my learnings
